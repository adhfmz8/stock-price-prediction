# Proposal 1: Predicting Stock Price Movements Using Ensemble Machine Learning Methods

## **Overview**

Develop an ensemble model that integrates various machine learning techniques to predict short-term stock price movements. The project will combine classical methods (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression) with advanced models (e.g., neural networks, RNNs) to capture both cross-sectional and time-series aspects of financial data.

## **Objectives**

- Build a robust predictive framework that leverages multiple ML models.
- Compare the predictive performance of classical statistical methods and deep learning approaches.
- Understand the advantages of ensemble techniques in noisy and volatile financial markets.

## **Approach**

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**

    - Gather historical stock price data and related quantitative indicators (volumes, technical indicators, etc.).
    - Clean and preprocess the data to create features suitable for both static and sequential analysis.
2. **Modeling:**

    - **Classical ML Techniques:**
        - Use decision trees and logistic regression to capture basic relationships.
        - Implement SVMs with kernel methods to introduce non-linearity.
    - **Deep Learning Techniques:**
        - Apply feedforward neural networks using gradient descent for optimization.
        - Implement RNNs to handle the time-series nature of stock prices.
    - **Ensemble Strategy:**
        - Combine predictions from the various models using techniques like weighted averaging or stacking.
3. **Evaluation:**

    - Use standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, etc.) on validation sets.
    - Backtest the model on historical data to assess its practical utility.
4. **Deployment:**

    - Develop a dashboard or a simple application that visualizes predictions and performance metrics.

## **Expected Outcome**

A comprehensive predictive tool that demonstrates proficiency in applying a variety of machine learning techniques to financial data, providing insights into stock price movements and offering a valuable portfolio piece for quantitative finance roles.
